# Data-Science-in-Python---2019
At the start of 2019, I challenged myself to code for 30 minutes a day for a period of at least 6 months.
I built a tracker to log the times each day into a csv file. And I created the notebook to show the process.

-TrackingHours.py: a script to be run from the terminal to log the start time, end time, and total number of minutes for each code session
-Plotting Time Worked.ipynb : Track the progess of the number of coding hours and plotting
-trackin1.csv : file containing logging information
-MonthlyCodingHours: Plot summarizing total hours worked per month
